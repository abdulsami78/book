<h2><u>c in depth</u></h2>
<p><b>The author of this book is Yashavant Kanetkar. Let Us C has become an important part of my life. I have created and nurtured it for last decade and half.<br> While doing so, I have received, in
    addition to the compliments, a lot of suggestions from students,developers, professors, publishers and authors. So much have their<br>
    inputs helped me in taking this book up to its fourteenth edition that ideally I should put their names too on the cover page.</b></p>

        <h2><u>Operating system concepts</u></h2>
        <p><b>AUTHOR- Abraham Silberschatz is the Sidney J. Weinberg Professor & Chair of Computer Science at Yale University. Prior to joining Yale, he was the Vice President
           <br> of the Information Sciences Research Center at Bell Laboratories. Prior to that, he held a chaired professorship in the Department of Computer Sciences at the
            University of Texas at Austin.<br>
            Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly, a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer-science
            education. This field is undergoing rapid change, as computers are now prevalent in virtually every application, from games for children through the<br>
            most sophisticated planning tools for governments and multinational firms.Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and it is on these that we base
            this book.<br><br><br><br></b> </p>

        <h2><u>computer organisation and architecture</u></h2>
        <p><b>AUTHOR-PRANABANANDA CHAKRABORTY Computer organization and architecture is becoming an increasingly important core subject in the areas of computer science and its applications, and information <br>
           technology constantly steers the relentless revolution going on in this discipline. This textbook demystifies the state of the art using a simple and step-by-step<br>
            development from traditional fundamentals to the most advanced concepts entwined with this subject, maintaining a reasonable balance among various theoretical principles,<br>
            numerous design approaches, and their actual practical implementations. Being driven by the diversified knowledge gained directly from working in the constantly changing<br>
            environment of the information technology (IT) industry, the author sets the stage by describing the modern issues in different areas of this subject.</b><br><br>

    <h2><u>Discrete mathematics</u></h2>
    <p><b>AUTHOR-SUSANNA S.EPP .Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", 
       <br> the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.Discrete mathematics
        <br> therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics
        <br> has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets[4] (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition
        <br> of the term "discrete mathematics."Indeed, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.</b>

    <h2><u>DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS</u></h2>
    <p><b>AUTHOR-NARSIMHA KARUMANCHI.Mother and Father, it is impossible to thank you adequately for everything you have done, from loving me unconditionally to raising me <br>
        in a stable household, where your persistent efforts and traditional values taught your children to celebrate and embrace life. I could not have asked for
        better parents or role-models. You showed me that anything is possible with faith, hard work and determination.<br>
        This book would not have been possible without the help of many people. I would like to express my gratitude to all of the people who provided support, talked things over, read, wrote, offered
       <br> comments, allowed me to quote their remarks and assisted in the editing, proofreading and design. In particular, I would like to thank the following individuals:
       <br> ▪ Mohan Mullapudi, IIT Bombay, Architect, dataRPM Pvt. Ltd.<br>
        ▪ Navin Kumar Jaiswal, Senior Consultant, Juniper Networks Inc.<br>
